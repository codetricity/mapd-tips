You may need to run \nsome of the scripts from either DOS or Powershell. You need to run \nnpm run start\n from bash.\n\n\nCommunity Installation Notes\n\n\n\n\nWindows 10 64 bit X99 architecture\n\n\nWindows 10 64 bit workstation\n\n\n\n\nVagrant Dev Containers\n\n\n\n\nVagrant is popular with developers and people involved in DevOps. It\nallows you to install MapD Charting inside a Linux VM and use development\ntools on your workstation. For example, you can install MapD Charting on Windows \ninside of a Linux VM and then use Visual Studio on Windows to develop a MapD \nCharting application. \n\n\nInstall Steps\n\n\n\n\nInstall \nVirtualBox\n\n\nInstall \nVagrant\n\n\nCopy \nVagrantfile\n into your development folder\n\n\nProvision MapD Charting VM with \nvagrant up\n\n\nssh into VM with \nvagrant ssh\n\n\ncd in \n/vagrant/mapd-charting/\n and run \nnpm run start\n\n\n\n\nInstall Tips\n\n\nOn Windows, you must run the Command Prompt as Administrator.\n\n\n\n\nAfter you ssh into the VM, your files will be in \n/vagrant/mapd-charting\n.\n\n\n\n\nThe install with \nvagrant up\n takes 10-20 minutes. The installation script will appear to\nhave no movement during several sections.\n\n\nCloning the mapd-charting repository took 4 minutes. There's no status report from the\nscript during this stage. It will look like the screen below for 4 minutes.\n\n\n\n\nThere will be many messages that say, \nWARN\n. You can fix these laters when you're \ndeveloping your application. The warning messages did not appear to impact the demos. The script stayed on the screen below for several minutes before moving on. There is no status update \nduring that time.\n\n\n\n\nAccessing Linux Files from Windows\n\n\nFiles placed in \n/vagrant/\n inside the Linux VM will be visible from\ninside the Windows directory you started Vagrant from.\n\n\n\n\nYou can now open your MapD Project folder in an IDE such as \nVisual Studio 2017.\n\n\n\n\nBrowser Access to MapD Visualization Projects\n\n\nUse the browser on your workstation. For example, point Microsoft Edge \non Windows to \nhttp://127.0.0.1/example/\n.\n\n\n\n\nIn this workflow, you are using your Windows IDE and your Windows browser to\nedit and view the MapD Charting application running on Linux.\n\n\nOnce the application is ready for public testing, move it to something\nlike AWS running Linux.\n\n\nFor more information on Vagrant configuration and workflows, refer to\nthe \nVagrant documentaion\n.\n\n\nWindows Subsystem for Linux\n\n\nMicrosoft designed their Windows Subsystem for Linux for with web developers working on server side applications. This method avoids the \nperformance hit of a VM and allows you to install MapD Charting using  Ubuntu 16.04 applications that talk to the Windows kernel.\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\n\n\n\nWindows 10 64 bit\n\n\nDeveloper Mode enabled\n\n\nWindows Subsystem for Linux\u200a\u2014\u200a\nInstall guide from Microsoft\n\n\n\n\nAt the Command Prompt, type \nbash\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: if you don\u2019t see a bash shell, go back and read the WSL install guide from Microsoft. There are also some tips at the end of this article.\n\n\n\n\ncd into a development folder you can access from Windows.\n\n\nclone mapd-charting repo into your development folder with\n\n\ngit clone https://github.com/mapd/mapd-charting.git\n\n\n\nInstall npm with \n\n\nsudo apt-get install npm\n\n\n\n\n\ninstall \nn\n using npm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough your experience may be different, I had some problems with \npermissions when I tried to use \nn\n to install node 5.12. To solve this,\n I used bash as root temporarily to install a specific version of node with n.\nWhen I do the install, I\u2019m going to include \nn\n in the \nPATH\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE: /mnt/e/Development/ is the directory of my Windows E: drive that I do development in. /node_modules is the folder that npm installed n into. \n\n\n\n\nInstall node 5.12 with this command:\n\n\nn 5.12\n\n\n\n\n\nExit bash running as root.\n\n\n\n\ncd\n into \nmapd-charting\n and install it with npm.\n\n\nnpm install\n\n\n\n\n\nThere will be a few warnings. This is fine. After the install finishes, install the peer dependency in \n\nmapbox-gl-js\n.\n\n\n\n\nnpm install mapbox-gl@https://github.com/mapd/mapbox-gl-js/tarball/9c04de6949fe498c8c79f5c0627dfd6d6321f307\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart the MapD Charting demos with:\n\n\nnpm run start\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can now access the demos from your web browser:\n\n\nhttp://127.0.0.1:8081/example/\n\n\n\n\nOpen up an editor like VS Code, Atom, or Sublime and start editing the demos to get more \nfamiliar with the \nMapD Charting API\n.\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Install Information\n\n\nI\u2019m installing Windows Subsystem for Linux from Powershell, not from the Microsoft store.\n\n\nSet your computer to \nDeveloper Mode\n.\n\n\n\n\nEnable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux\n\n\n\nRun bash at the command prompt. It will install Windows Subsystem for Linux.",
