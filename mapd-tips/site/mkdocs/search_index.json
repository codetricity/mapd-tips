It\nallows you to install MapD Charting inside a Linux VM and use development\ntools on your workstation. For example, you can install MapD Charting on Windows \ninside of a Linux VM and then use Visual Studio on Windows to develop a MapD \nCharting application. \n\n\nInstall Steps\n\n\n\n\nInstall \nVirtualBox\n\n\nInstall \nVagrant\n\n\nCopy \nVagrantfile\n into your development folder\n\n\nProvision MapD Charting VM with \nvagrant up\n\n\nssh into VM with \nvagrant ssh\n\n\ncd in \n/vagrant/mapd-charting/\n and run \nnpm run start\n\n\n\n\nInstall Tips\n\n\nOn Windows, you must run the Command Prompt as Administrator.\n\n\n\n\nAfter you ssh into the VM, your files will be in \n/vagrant/mapd-charting\n.\n\n\n\n\nThe install with \nvagrant up\n takes 10-20 minutes. The installation script will appear to\nhave no movement during several sections.\n\n\nCloning the mapd-charting repository took 4 minutes. There's no status report from the\nscript during this stage. It will look like the screen below for 4 minutes.\n\n\n\n\nThere will be many messages that say, \nWARN\n. You can fix these laters when you're \ndeveloping your application. The warning messages did not appear to impact the demos. The script stayed on the screen below for several minutes before moving on. There is no status update \nduring that time.\n\n\n\n\nAccessing Linux Files from Windows\n\n\nFiles placed in \n/vagrant/\n inside the Linux VM will be visible from\ninside the Windows directory you started Vagrant from.\n\n\n\n\nYou can now open your MapD Project folder in an IDE such as \nVisual Studio 2017.\n\n\n\n\nBrowser Access to MapD Visualization Projects\n\n\nUse the browser on your workstation. For example, point Microsoft Edge \non Windows to \nhttp://127.0.0.1/example/\n.\n\n\n\n\nIn this workflow, you are using your Windows IDE and your Windows browser to\nedit and view the MapD Charting application running on Linux.\n\n\nOnce the application is ready for public testing, move it to something\nlike AWS running Linux.\n\n\nFor more information on Vagrant configuration and workflows, refer to\nthe \nVagrant documentaion\n.",
